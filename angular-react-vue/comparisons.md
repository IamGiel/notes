<h1> Angular | React | Vue | Pros-Cons</h1> By: Max S. and Vikram K.
Angular = {
-has modularity
-use components with modules
-dependency injection
-easy to add routing and form validations
-very popular and many websites use it
-typescript forces developer to write better code
- Templates are separate - this means you can have your design team create the HTML and   CSS and you can add your JS bits.
-Since all major dependencies are courtesy of the Angular team, low risk of dependency    hell.
}
React = {
  - uses jsx, where you use html elements with javascript
  - you have to use `className` instead of `class` because of jsx
  - Componentization is a major plus, the fact that Angular 2 moved in this direction     is telling.
  - Multi-device. Angular, while it has Cordova, is nowhere near as versatile as React.
  - JSX makes it difficult to separate responsibility between developer and designer.
  - NPM hell - you have to add extra packages (e.g routing, form validations)
  - Lack of opinion on app structure can hurt if your devs are not used to designing      and maintaining large scale front-end apps. You need to have developers who are       Facebook level smart.

}
Vue = {
  - separation of template, css and javascript code is a plus++
  - like, React, it is dependency hell
  - es5 and es6 friendly
  - it uses javascript, and also can use typescript but dont have to, gives  
    it flexibility.
  - router is provided by the Vue team and so no dependency needed for that purpose.
  - But like REACT, you hav eto reply on packages (eg validations) so you may have to update.
  - no dependency injection.
  - has a great documentation!
  - A con, it doesn't have a great backup like facebook or google. Alibaba uses Vue so    it may soon pick up.
